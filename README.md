# workout-tracker

## Description
a workout tracker using a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and an Express router.


## Goals

This app is designed to manage your workouts and track them.You should be able to:
* Create a new workout
* Update a workout
* Track your workout progress

## Complications

During the process of making this workout site, I did run into some problems: 

* Working with a pre-made front-end:
    * This was probably the most frustrating homework assignment of the whole course. Although the instructions explicity stated not to touch the front-end, the code that was written was not able to work as-is. However, it was a good experience because as a junior developer, I will most likely be working with code that someone else has written. 

## Credits and Thanks
Thanks to Colin for spending a lot of time with me on this assignment and helping me figure out the front-end issues.
